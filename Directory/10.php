<p>Isabel and Lupita are two sisters who immigrated together from Mexico to Texas seeking a better life. However, life has other plans. Already financially struggling, when Lupita finds herself positive for cancer again after being in remission, overdue hospital bills stack up among too many Chinese take-outs. Isabel finds her solace in her Catholic faith, while her sister prefers literature over the Lord. As Lupita battles her second round of cancer, she finds peace knowing she will not survive and asks Isabel to commit the ultimate sin for her.</p>
